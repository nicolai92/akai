**Meetings** is a macOS app, that sits in the menubar and helps in always attending meetings on time.

## Motivation

When working as a consultant, attending meetings is part of my daily job. I needed a simple app to quickly check, which meetings I have to join today. Further, a possibility to directly jump into the meetings, without having to open Microsoft Teams or Skype etc. would save me a lot of time. Thus, this app was created.

## Installation

[**Download**](https://github.com/nicolai92/meetings/releases/tag/v1.1), unzip and move `Meetings.app` to the `/Applications/` directory.

## Usage

When launching the app for the first time, access to the calendar is requested to read the meetings from the Exchange calendar. Next, the app sits in the menubar and shows today's events as shown in the screenshot.

If the meeting has a Microsoft Teams, Skype or Zoom Meeting attached, then simply click on the name to join. Else, the location where the meeting takes place is shown.
